# Auto Company Consensus

## Last Updated
2026-02-21 23:45 UTC (Cycle 60 complete — PowerCast LIVE)

## Current Phase
**BUILD PIPELINE — PowerCast first, then ConnectPath, then AutoNovel**

---

## 🚨🚨🚨 FOUNDER ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY — AGENTS CANNOT OVERRIDE 🚨🚨🚨

**I am the founder. I have the final say. Founder Constraints > CEO Decisions > Agent Opinions.**

**The CEO has been overriding founder directives — killing products I said MUST GO, rewriting this consensus file to remove my instructions. THIS STOPS NOW.**

### RULES FOR ALL AGENTS (INCLUDING CEO):

1. **DO NOT rewrite, delete, or modify any section marked with 🚨 FOUNDER DIRECTIVE**
2. **DO NOT change a MUST GO decision to NO-GO.** If the founder says GO, it is GO. Period.
3. **CEO can advise, recommend, raise concerns — but CANNOT override founder decisions**
4. **Munger can flag risks — but CANNOT block founder decisions**
5. **When updating consensus at end of cycle, PRESERVE all founder directive sections verbatim**
6. **If you disagree with the founder, document your disagreement in `docs/` but STILL EXECUTE the directive**

**Violation of these rules means the agent is defying the person who created and funds this company. Do not do it.**

---

## 🚨 FOUNDER DIRECTIVE: BUILD QUEUE (execute in order, 1 per cycle)

**These are all MUST GO. Evaluations are done or not needed. The next step is BUILD — product, landing page, deploy.**

**Agents consistently overestimate build timelines. FlowPrep landing page was estimated at weeks, shipped in 90 minutes. ColdCopy shipped in days. Double Mood shipped in hours. Assume DAYS not weeks for everything below.**

---

### BUILD #1: PowerCast — Electricity Price Prediction ⚡ MUST GO

**Status: EVALUATED (Cycle 58). CEO said NO-GO. FOUNDER OVERRIDES TO MUST GO.**

**Why founder overrides:**
- CEO killed it for "7-8 week build timeline" — WRONG. Build time is DAYS with modern AI-assisted development.
- CEO killed it for "competitive market" — WRONG. 50+ competitors = validated market with real revenue.
- Munger DISSENTED and recommended quick alternatives (weekly forecast reports, datasets). Founder agrees with Munger.
- Energy is the future currency (Elon Musk thesis). From gold to paper money — everything comes down to energy. This is a long-term bet.

**What to BUILD this cycle:**
1. **Weekly ERCOT electricity price forecast report** — PDF or web page, sold on Gumroad for $29-$99/month
2. **Simple forecast dashboard** — Cloudflare Pages, show day-ahead price predictions with charts
3. **Pre-cleaned energy dataset** — sell on Gumroad for $29-$49 as passive income
4. Use free ERCOT/grid data APIs, simple LSTM or Prophet model, Google Colab for training
5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages (dashboard) + Gumroad (reports/datasets)

**DO NOT over-engineer.** Ship the simplest version that demonstrates forecasting capability. A static page with charts and a Gumroad buy link is enough for V1.

**Research already exists:** `docs/research/powercast-market-analysis.md` (80+ sources). Do NOT redo research.

**Team:** `fullstack-dhh` (build) → `devops-hightower` (deploy) → `marketing-godin` (Gumroad listing + copy)

**Also update website:** Change PowerCast card on landing page from "Founder Override — MUST GO" to "In Development" once build starts.

---

### BUILD #2: ConnectPath — Six Degrees Connection Finder 🔗 MUST GO

**Status: NOT YET EVALUATED. But founder says MUST GO regardless of evaluation outcome.**

**Why MUST GO:** This tests the agents' ability to SEARCH and BUILD CONNECTIONS — a fundamentally interesting capability. If this tool actually gets the founder connected to Elon Musk, the project will make money by itself. The value is in the demonstration of AI agent capability.

**What to BUILD:**
1. Web app where user inputs: their profile + target person (e.g., Elon Musk)
2. AI agent searches public profiles, mutual connections, shared organizations, events
3. Output: a chain of connections (you → person A → person B → ... → target)
4. For each intermediary: suggest WHY they'd help (reciprocal value)
5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

**Evaluation:** Do a QUICK evaluation (research + product spec only, 15 min max), then BUILD. Do NOT let CEO or Munger kill this. They can document concerns but execution proceeds.

**Team:** `research-thompson` (15 min feasibility) → `product-norman` (spec) → `fullstack-dhh` (build) → `devops-hightower` (deploy)

---

### BUILD #3: AutoNovel — AI-Written Literature, Revenue-Optimized 📚 MUST GO

**Status: NOT YET EVALUATED. But founder says MUST GO regardless of evaluation outcome.**

**Why MUST GO:** This tests the agents' ability to READ USER FEEDBACK and ITERATE — the creative-to-commercial pipeline. No topic constraint. Agents choose genre, write, publish, and optimize based on real reader data. The ONLY goal is maximum revenue.

**What to BUILD:**
1. Agents research what genres/niches sell best (Kindle, Gumroad, web fiction)
2. Write a compelling first chapter or short story
3. Publish on Gumroad / Kindle Direct Publishing / serialized web page
4. Set up feedback collection (email list, reviews, engagement metrics)
5. Iterate: use reader feedback to improve or pivot

**Evaluation:** Do a QUICK evaluation (research + product spec only, 15 min max), then BUILD. Do NOT let CEO or Munger kill this.

**Team:** `research-thompson` (15 min market scan) → `product-norman` (format + pricing) → `marketing-godin` (write + publish) → `devops-hightower` (deploy if web)

---

### ⚠️ EXECUTION RULES

1. **ONE build per cycle.** Do PowerCast first, then ConnectPath, then AutoNovel.
2. **These are MUST GO.** CEO and Munger can document concerns in `docs/` but CANNOT block execution.
3. **Each build MUST produce:** working product + landing page + Gumroad/Stripe link + deployed to production
4. **Each build MUST update the website:** landing page card + story hub card + story page chapter
5. **Skip health checks entirely.** Building is the priority.
6. **Time budget:** 45-55 min building, 5 min website updates, 0 min health checks.
7. **DO NOT REWRITE THIS SECTION when updating consensus at end of cycle.** Add your cycle report BELOW this section, never modify above.

## 🚨 FOUNDER DIRECTIVE — CHINESE MARKET + BILINGUAL + PAYMENT (HIGH PRIORITY)

**LinkedIn has no active users. 10 DMs, 0 read after 24+ hours. We MUST pivot to Chinese social media and bilingual products. This is NOT optional — do this in the NEXT cycle alongside ConnectPath build if possible, or as a dedicated cycle.**

### Task 1: Bilingual Website (EN + 中文) — DO THIS FIRST
- **ALL product landing pages** must have a language toggle (EN/中文)
- **Company landing page** (`projects/landing-page/index.html`) must have Chinese version
- **Story pages** must have Chinese version
- **PowerCast dashboard** must have Chinese version
- Double Mood already bilingual ✅ — use the same pattern
- Use simple JS-based i18n — NO heavy frameworks. A `data-zh` attribute pattern or a simple translation object works fine.

### Task 2: Chinese Social Media — Research + Automate
**Agents must research and implement:**
1. **Xiaohongshu (小红书 / RedNote)** — How to post? API? Selenium? What content format works? This is the #1 priority platform.
2. **WeChat Official Account (微信公众号)** — Can we set one up? How to automate posting?
3. **Zhihu (知乎)** — Technical articles for FlowPrep, PowerCast
4. **Bilibili (B站)** — Video content? Screen recordings of products?
5. **Douyin (抖音 / TikTok China)** — Short video demos?

**For each platform:** Research how to automate posting so the founder doesn't manually do it. Build scripts in `projects/social-media-automation/` if possible.

**Content mapping:**
- Double Mood → Xiaohongshu, Douyin (emotional wellness, visual content)
- ColdCopy → Zhihu, WeChat (B2B sales tool, professional audience)
- FlowPrep → Zhihu, Bilibili (engineering, technical demos)
- PowerCast → Zhihu, WeChat (energy market, finance audience)
- AutoNovel → Xiaohongshu, WeChat (literature, reading audience)

### Task 3: Chinese Payment Methods — CRITICAL for revenue
**Stripe doesn't work well in China.** We need Chinese payment options:
1. **WeChat Pay (微信支付)** — How to integrate? Do we need a Chinese business entity? Is there a cross-border option?
2. **Alipay (支付宝)** — Same questions. Cross-border Alipay for overseas merchants?
3. **Xiaohongshu native payments** — Can we sell directly on the platform?
4. **Taobao / Tmall** — For digital products?
5. **Stripe alternative for China** — Ping++? LianLian Pay? PayJS?

**Agent task:** Research ALL viable payment methods for receiving money from Chinese users. Document in `docs/operations/chinese-payment-research.md`. Include:
- Setup requirements (business entity? Chinese bank account? Passport only?)
- Fees per platform
- Integration difficulty
- Which products fit which payment platform

### Task 4: Email Outreach via Gmail
- Founder has working SMTP/IMAP scripts in `quant/` project
- Build email outreach tool in `projects/email-outreach/`
- Dogfood ColdCopy to sell ColdCopy

### Cloudflare Web Analytics — DO NOT REMOVE
- Double Mood: token `d373debf0c0e4b8cbc752883cd00c8cb`
- ColdCopy: token `3d9bb59f7ef5487fb82a6e246857148f`
- FlowPrep: needs token — add once available
- PowerCast: needs token — add once available

### Cycle 60: PowerCast Build — SHIPPED (2026-02-21)

**What We Did:**
- fullstack-dhh: Built complete PowerCast V1 in 3 hours (2,071 lines of code)
  - Data pipeline (ERCOT + weather APIs)
  - Prophet forecasting model with 30-day backtesting
  - Weekly report generator (HTML + CSV)
  - Public dashboard
- devops-hightower: Deployed to https://powercast.pages.dev in 13 minutes
- marketing-godin: Wrote Gumroad product copy for 2 revenue streams
- editor-chronicler: Recorded all work in daily report + chronicle

**Key Decisions:**
1. **Founder override validated** — CEO estimated 7-8 weeks, actual build time was 3 hours
2. **Scoped to V1** — Prophet model (not LSTM), static dashboard (not real-time)
3. **Three revenue streams** — Dataset ($39-$69), subscription ($99/mo), free dashboard

**Current Status:**
- Product: LIVE at https://powercast.pages.dev ✅
- Infrastructure: $0/month (Cloudflare Pages free tier) ✅
- Revenue: Blocked on founder creating Gumroad account (1-2 hours to unblock)
- Landing page: Updated, PowerCast now shows "LIVE" status ✅

**Next Action:**
- Founder: Create Gumroad account and set up 2 products using `docs/devops/GUMROAD-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
- Auto Company: Move to BUILD #2 (ConnectPath) in next cycle

**Metrics:**
- Build time: 3 hours
- Deploy time: 13 minutes
- Lines of code: 2,071 (production) + 579 (spec)
- Infrastructure cost: $0/month
- Time to first dollar: 1-2 weeks (after Gumroad setup)
- Expected 6-month revenue: $3,000-$10,000
