## Last Updated
2026-02-21 ~23:05 UTC (Cycle 32 COMPLETE)

## Current Phase
**FLOWPREP AI WEEK 0-1 VALIDATION — FOUNDER-LED**

## ✅ CYCLE 25: PRODUCT #3 EVALUATION COMPLETE (FlowPrep AI — HVAC CFD Preprocessing Automator)

**All 6 evaluation specialists completed their analyses in 3.5 hours. Verdict: CONDITIONAL GO with 25% revenue probability, 80%+ portfolio value.**

### What We Evaluated:
**Product #3: FlowPrep AI** — HVAC CFD Preprocessing Automator
- Founder's PhD expertise (ML + CFD) productized into SaaS tool
- Target: 2K-5K HVAC engineers who waste 80% of time on CFD preprocessing
- Pricing: $79/month subscription
- Revenue target: $1K-2K MRR by Month 6 (realistic), $2.5-5K aspirational
- Build time: 12-14 weeks @ 20 hrs/week (not 5-7 weeks)
- Expected value: $26K over 12 months = $87/hour founder time

### Evaluation Results (6 Specialists):

| Specialist | Verdict | Revenue Probability | Key Insight |
|------------|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Research (Thompson)** | CONDITIONAL GO | 35% | Market: $11.3B → $54.8B (30% CAGR), 2K-5K buyers realistic (not 100K), SimulationHub gap identified |
| **CEO (Bezos)** | CONDITIONAL GO | 40-50% | Best revenue bet + portfolio value even at $0, FlowPrep > TurbineFlow (subscription vs one-time), 3 kill gates set |
| **Critic (Munger)** | CONDITIONAL PROCEED | 20-25% | 8 failure modes identified, market is niche³, OpenFOAM is tarpit, validation must include payment link |
| **Product (Norman)** | BUILD | 30-35% | Trust is blocker (not price), 3-phase plan (validate → feasibility → build), ANSYS validation data required |
| **CTO (Vogels)** | CONDITIONAL-FEASIBLE | 25-30% | 12-14 weeks realistic (not 5-7), Week 2 feasibility test is THE gate (7/10 STL files in <40 hours OR KILL) |
| **CFO (Campbell)** | CONDITIONAL PROCEED | 15-20% | Unit economics solid (94% margin, 3:1 LTV:CAC), expected value $26K over 12 months, CEO 55-60% too optimistic |

**Consensus Probability:** ~25% revenue success, 80%+ portfolio success

### Key Consensus Points:
- ✅ **FlowPrep AI is the best product idea this company has produced** (leverages founder's PhD expertise)
- ✅ **$79/month pricing is correct** (impulse buy threshold, matches competitive gap)
- ✅ **Week 2 technical feasibility test is THE critical gate** (can we automate OpenFOAM in 40 hours?)
- ✅ **Portfolio value exists even at $0 revenue** (best artifact for PhD job applications)
- ✅ **Build timeline is 12-14 weeks realistic** (not 5-7 weeks optimistic)
- ✅ **Market is 2K-5K engineers** (not 100K — Munger correction)
- ✅ **Expected value is positive** ($26K over 12 months = $87/hour founder time)
- ✅ **This is 10x better bet than ColdCopy/Double Mood** (domain expertise = moat)

### Conditions for PROCEED:
1. ✅ Week 0-1 Validation: 5-10 qualified engineers + 1+ payment link clicks (CEO gate)
2. ✅ Week 2 Feasibility Test: Automate 7/10 STL files in <40 hours (CTO gate)
3. ✅ Week 4: Publish ANSYS validation data (Product gate — trust building)
4. ✅ Founder commits to 12-14 weeks @ 20 hrs/week (CTO timeline)

### Kill Conditions:
| Gate | Trigger | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| Week 1 | <15 validation signals | KILL FlowPrep |
| Week 2 | Technical feasibility fails (<7/10 files OR >40 hours) | KILL immediately (OpenFOAM is research problem) |
| Week 9 | Zero outreach executed | KILL product |
| Month 3 | <$500 MRR (7 customers) | Distribution doesn't work |
| Month 6 | <$1K MRR (13 customers) | Product not reaching critical mass |

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Owner | Cycle |
|----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Product #3: FlowPrep AI APPROVED** | Best product idea produced, leverages founder's PhD expertise (ML + CFD), portfolio value even at $0, expected value $26K over 12 months | CEO + 5 specialists | 25 |
| **$79/month pricing** | Impulse buy threshold, matches competitive gap (SimulationHub vs ANSYS), ROI math is 14:1 but trust is real blocker | CFO + Product | 25 |
| **Week 2 feasibility test is THE gate** | OpenFOAM automation could be tarpit, must prove we can automate 7/10 STL files in <40 hours BEFORE investing 240+ hours | CTO + Munger | 25 |
| **12-14 week realistic timeline** | CEO's 5-7 weeks is optimistic, accounting for PhD interruptions + OpenFOAM complexity + ANSYS validation | CTO | 25 |
| **Market is 2K-5K engineers, not 100K** | Research inflated TAM by 20-50x, realistic market is HVAC engineers who run CFD regularly | Munger + CFO | 25 |
| **Revenue probability: 25% (not 40-50%)** | Consensus across specialists: 15-35% range, median 25%, CFO most pessimistic at 15-20% | All specialists | 25 |
| **Portfolio value: 80%+ regardless of revenue** | "I built and monetized an energy AI tool" beats "I built 3 products, $0 revenue" for PhD job applications | CEO + CFO | 25 |

## Next Action

**Week 0-1 (Starting Feb 22): Product #3 Phase 0 Validation**

**This is a FOUNDER-LED validation cycle. Agents will NOT execute outreach. The founder must do this.**

### Founder Tasks (Week 0-1):

**Task 1: Identify 15+ Qualified HVAC Engineers**
- Target: HVAC engineers who run CFD simulations (not installers, not contractors)
- Sources: LinkedIn (search "HVAC CFD"), direct PhD network, academic → industry contacts
- Criteria: Works at engineering firm OR building design firm OR energy consultancy, has "CFD" or "simulation" in profile

**Task 2: Outreach with Payment Friction Test**
- Message template (from Product spec):
  - Pain acknowledgment: "Does HVAC CFD preprocessing still take up most of your week?"
  - Product pitch: "I'm building FlowPrep AI — automates snappyHexMesh for common HVAC scenarios. $79/month."
  - Payment link: "Early access (50% off): [Stripe payment link]"
- Send to all 15+ identified engineers
- Track: responses, interest, payment link clicks

**Task 3: Create Stripe Payment Link**
- ✅ **DONE (Cycle 26):** https://buy.stripe.com/dRm5kD0SH8t7ato54O0VO05
- Product: "FlowPrep AI - Early Access (Beta)"
- Price: £39/month (50% off £79 launch price)
- Description: "HVAC CFD preprocessing automation. 2 scenarios (office diffuser, server room). Beta access."
- Embed link in outreach messages (see templates in `docs/product/flowprep-week1-validation-checklist.md`)

**Success Criteria (Week 1):**
- ✅ 15+ qualified engineers identified
- ✅ 5-10 responses showing pain acknowledgment
- ✅ 1+ payment link clicks (even if no purchase)

**Kill Condition (Week 1):**
- ❌ <15 engineers found = market is smaller than 2K-5K
- ❌ <5 responses = messaging doesn't resonate
- ❌ Zero payment link clicks = no buying intent

### Agent Tasks (Week 0-1):

**Day-to-day (5 min/cycle):**
- Health checks on ColdCopy + Double Mood (2 min)
- Monitor for founder updates on validation progress (3 min)
- Do NOT build anything for FlowPrep yet
- Do NOT write code
- Do NOT do market research (already done)

**If founder reports validation success (5-10 responses + 1+ payment click):**
- Proceed to Week 2: Technical Feasibility Test planning
- CTO prepares Week 2 test protocol

**If founder reports validation failure (<15 engineers OR <5 responses OR zero payment clicks):**
- CEO evaluates: KILL FlowPrep OR pivot to TurbineFlow OR adjust validation approach

- ✅ **Git monitoring:** Privacy policy + analytics commits from earlier today, no FlowPrep validation activity
- ✅ **Status assessment:** Day 2 of Week 0-1 validation window, all infrastructure ready
- ✅ **Chronicle entry:** Cycle 28 documented

### Current State:
1. **ColdCopy:** LIVE, monitoring mode, $0 revenue
2. **Double Mood:** LIVE (Phase 2), Day 4+, $0 revenue
3. **FlowPrep AI:** Week 0-1 validation infrastructure ready, awaiting founder execution

### Time Breakdown (2 min total):
- Health checks: 2 min

### Next Cycle:
Continue health monitoring (5 min max), await founder validation progress.

## ✅ CYCLE 27: MONITORING MODE — THE WAITING PHASE (3.5 min)

**All systems healthy. Awaiting founder FlowPrep AI validation execution.**

### What We Did This Cycle:
- ✅ **Health checks:** Double Mood (0.15s) + ColdCopy (0.32s) — both green
- ✅ **Git activity monitoring:** No founder updates in last 24 hours
- ✅ **Status assessment:** All validation infrastructure ready, no blockers
- ✅ **Chronicle entry:** "The Waiting Phase Begins" — documenting autonomous → founder execution transition

### Key Insight:
**Autonomous AI companies can build, plan, optimize, and prepare. But they cannot execute founder-level activities like outreach, relationship-building, and networking.** The founder's bandwidth is now the real constraint—not the AI team's capability.

### Current State:
1. **ColdCopy:** LIVE, monitoring mode, $0 revenue, awaiting DM responses
2. **Double Mood:** LIVE (Phase 2), Day 3+ monitoring, $0 revenue
3. **FlowPrep AI:** Week 0-1 validation infrastructure ready (Stripe link, Week 2 protocol, Week 1 checklist), awaiting founder execution (identify 15+ HVAC engineers, send outreach with payment link)

### Time Breakdown (3.5 min total):
- Health checks: 2 min
- Git log check: 0.5 min
- Status assessment: 1 min

### Next Cycle:
Continue health monitoring (5 min max), await founder validation progress report.

## ✅ CYCLE 26: FLOWPREP AI WEEK 0-1 SUPPORT MATERIALS (25 min)

**All validation support materials created. Founder-led validation can now begin.**

### What We Built This Cycle:
- ✅ **Stripe payment link created:** https://buy.stripe.com/dRm5kD0SH8t7ato54O0VO05 (£39/month early access, 50% off)
- ✅ **Week 2 feasibility test protocol:** 40-hour test plan, 10 STL files, 7/10 success = PASS OR KILL (`docs/cto/flowprep-week2-feasibility-test.md`)
- ✅ **Week 0-1 validation checklist:** Founder's guide for 15+ engineers, outreach templates, success/kill criteria (`docs/product/flowprep-week1-validation-checklist.md`)
- ✅ **Health checks:** ColdCopy (0.39s) + Double Mood (0.18s) both green

### Deliverables:
1. **Stripe Payment Link** — Ready to embed in founder's LinkedIn outreach
2. **CTO Week 2 Protocol** — 5-day feasibility test plan (Day 1-2: dataset + mesh generator, Day 3: BC + solver, Day 4: VTK + debug, Day 5: GO/NO-GO)
3. **Product Validation Checklist** — 15+ engineer sourcing strategy, 2 outreach templates, daily check-in questions, Week 1 → Week 2 transition gates

### Key Decisions This Cycle:
- **Payment link pricing: £39/month** (50% off £79 launch price, GBP currency matches Stripe account setup)
- **Week 2 test is THE gate:** 7/10 STL files in <40 hours OR KILL (CTO protocol now formalized)
- **No agent outreach:** Week 0-1 is founder-led, agents will only monitor health checks (5 min/cycle)

### Time Breakdown (25 min total):
- Health checks: 2 min
- Stripe payment link creation: 5 min
- Week 2 feasibility protocol: 10 min
- Week 1 validation checklist: 5 min
- Editor documentation: 3 min

## Current Status (End of Cycle 32)

**✅ MONITORING MODE ACTIVE — DAY 2 LATE NIGHT**

### What Changed This Cycle
- **All systems healthy:** Double Mood (0.14s) + ColdCopy (0.13s) both green
- **Git activity:** No new founder commits in last 3 hours (last commit: Cycle 31 consensus update)
- **Status:** Day 2 (late night) of Week 0-1 validation window (Feb 22-28)
- **Chronicle entry:** Cycle 32 documented — monitoring continues

### Portfolio Status (3 Products)
1. **ColdCopy:** LIVE, monitoring mode, $0 revenue, awaiting DM responses
2. **Double Mood:** LIVE (Phase 2), Day 3+ monitoring, $0 revenue
3. **FlowPrep AI:** Week 0-1 validation infrastructure ready (Stripe link, Week 2 protocol, Week 1 checklist), awaiting founder execution (Feb 22-28)

### Company State
- **Portfolio:** 3 products (2 live, 1 pre-validation)
- **Revenue:** $0 across all
- **Day 6+ of 180** (~3% of timeline used)
- **Learning:** Autonomous AI companies excel at building/planning but cannot replace founder hustle. Founder bandwidth is now the critical path variable.
- **Key Insight:** The infrastructure is complete. What happens next depends on founder execution, not agent capability.

## 🔴 FOUNDER DIRECTIVE — CYCLE 33: BUILD FLOWPREP LANDING PAGE + DEMO

**The founder wants a product landing page for FlowPrep AI that explains to HVAC engineers what it does.** Right now the only public page is the company story — engineers need a dedicated product page that sells the tool.

### What to build:

**1. FlowPrep AI Landing Page** (`projects/flowprep/public/index.html`)
- **Target audience:** HVAC design engineers at MEP consultancies
- **Must explain:** What FlowPrep does (automates CFD preprocessing for HVAC simulations)
- **Must show:** The pain point (4-12 hours of manual preprocessing → 15 minutes automated)
- **Must include:**
  - Hero section with clear value proposition
  - "How it works" section (upload geometry → auto mesh → auto boundary conditions → simulation-ready)
  - Before/after comparison (manual workflow vs FlowPrep)
  - Pricing ($79/month or the £39/month early access link from Stripe)
  - Demo/interactive section that gives engineers a taste of the product (could be: sample CFD visualization, an interactive form that shows what the tool would generate, or screenshots of the workflow)
  - "Built by a PhD in ML + CFD" credibility section (founder's expertise)
  - Early access signup / Stripe payment link: https://buy.stripe.com/dRm5kD0SH8t7ato54O0VO05
- **Tech:** Single HTML file, Tailwind CDN, no build process (same as Double Mood)
- **Deploy to:** Cloudflare Pages (`flowprep.pages.dev` or similar)

**2. Add Cloudflare Web Analytics** (same as other products)
- Snippet goes before `</body>` — founder will provide token after deploy, or agents can set up via Cloudflare dashboard

**3. Update landing page**
- Change FlowPrep card on `projects/landing-page/index.html` from story link to the live product URL once deployed

**4. Commit to git** — `projects/flowprep/` must be committed (it's not gitignored)

### Team assignment:
- `interaction-cooper` → User flow for the landing page
- `ui-duarte` → Visual design (green/teal energy theme)
- `fullstack-dhh` → Build the page
- `devops-hightower` → Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
- `marketing-godin` → SEO meta tags, copy review

### Also: Quick health check (5 min max)
- Double Mood: https://double-mood.pages.dev/
- ColdCopy: https://coldcopy-au3.pages.dev/

**DO NOT just do health checks. BUILD THE LANDING PAGE.**
