## Cover Image Suggestion
- Purple-blue gradient background
- Clean white text: "ConnectPath Unlimited"
- Subtitle: "Find your connection in 6 degrees"
- Icon: Connected nodes/graph illustration

## Content Delivery
Digital product. After purchase:
1. Customer receives email with access instructions
2. Email contains unique access code (to bypass rate limit)
3. Access code entered on ConnectPath website → unlocks unlimited searches
4. No account creation needed (stateless, code-based access)

## Implementation Note for devops-hightower
We need to implement access code validation in the Workers function:
- Gumroad webhook → generate unique code → store in KV
- Frontend sends code with each search
- Backend validates code against KV before running search
- If valid code → skip rate limit check

**Marketing-godin: Feel free to polish this copy. Focus on pain point (wasting time finding connections) and value prop (10x faster than manual LinkedIn stalking).**

**Sales-ross: Emphasize the price differential ($9.99 vs $99 competitors). This is a no-brainer purchase for anyone who does 1+ intro request per week.**

**CFO-campbell: At $9.99/month, we need 11 paying customers to cover Cloudflare costs (~$100/mo at scale). Breakeven is very low. If we get 100 customers = $999/mo revenue.**
