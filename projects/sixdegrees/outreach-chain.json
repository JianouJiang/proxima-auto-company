I've been working on large-scale energy optimization for electrified systems (MINLP models with 60K+ variables) and believe there's a strategic opportunity to connect energy systems research with industrial AI applications at companies like Tesla.\n\nWould you be open to a brief conversation about how PyPSA's framework could inform industrial energy optimization, and potentially connecting with researchers who might be interested in this bridge? Your perspective on the research-to-industry pathway would be invaluable.\n\nBest regards,\nJianou Jiang\nOxford Thermofluids Institute\njianou.works@gmail.com"
