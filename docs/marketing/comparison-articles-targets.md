Subject: Suggestion: Add CronPulse to your cron monitoring comparison

Hi,

I noticed your article on cron job monitoring tools. I recently released CronPulse —
an open-source cron job monitoring tool built on Cloudflare Workers.

Key differentiators:
- Open source (AGPL-3.0): https://github.com/nicepkg/cronpulse
- Runs on Cloudflare's edge network (300+ nodes, <5ms response)
- Cheapest option: $5/mo for 50 checks
- CLI tool + GitHub Action included
- Self-hostable on Cloudflare Workers

Website: https://cron-pulse.com

Would you consider adding it to your comparison? Happy to provide any details.

Thanks!
```
