# Week 2 Adaptive Strategy — Executive Summary

**Created:** Cycle 68 (2026-02-22)
**Author:** Operations Agent (Paul Graham)
**Audience:** Founder (execute on Day 7 after reading Day 1-7 results)
**Time to Read:** 10 minutes
**Time to Execute:** Zero additional planning (just follow scenario playbook)

---

## WHAT IS THIS?

After you launch ColdCopy on Day 1 and run through the full execution package, you'll have data by end of Day 7.

This document gives you **3 complete Week 2 playbooks** — one for each possible outcome.

You don't need to think. You just:
1. Check Day 7 metrics
2. Find your scenario below
3. Execute the exact actions listed (copy-paste ready)

---

## THE 3 SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: You Got 5-10+ Customers ($185-500+ Revenue)

**What This Means:** Your Reddit posts resonated. The paywall converts. You have PMF signal.

**Week 2 Strategy:** SCALE
- Keep doing exactly what worked
- Email the 300+ free signups (nurture sequence ready to send)
- Launch on Product Hunt (Day 11)
- Post 2 more Reddit posts to new subreddits
- Goal: 10-20 customers by Day 14

**Time Commitment:** 2-3 hours/day (manageable)

**File:** See `docs/operations/coldcopy-week2-adaptive-strategy.md` — **SCENARIO A: SCALE WHAT WORKS** (page 1)

---

### Scenario B: You Got 1-4 Customers (Traffic OK, Low Conversion)

**What This Means:** Your content is getting traffic, but the funnel is leaking. Either landing page copy is weak, paywall timing is wrong, or pricing feels high.

**Week 2 Strategy:** DIAGNOSE & FIX
- Analyze what's working (which post drove traffic)
- A/B test pricing ($49 lifetime vs. $19/month only)
- Lower paywall trigger (3 sequences → 1 sequence, forces faster decision)
- Send re-engagement email to free users who didn't convert
- Fix landing page copy or messaging
- Goal: Get conversion to 3-5% (double the rate)

**Time Commitment:** 1-2 hours/day (light)

**File:** See `docs/operations/coldcopy-week2-adaptive-strategy.md` — **SCENARIO B: FIX CONVERSION LEAKS** (page 2)

---

### Scenario C: You Got 0 Customers (Low Traffic OR Negative Feedback)

**What This Means:** Reddit either ghosted you, or community rejected the messaging. Product isn't the problem — distribution or positioning is.

**Week 2 Strategy:** PIVOT
- Shift from Reddit to Hacker News (different audience)
- OR use warm outreach instead (email 100 founders directly)
- OR change landing page positioning (lead with "research assistant" not "AI writer")
- OR change email subject line angle
- Goal: Find 1+ customer via new channel

**Time Commitment:** 1-2 hours/day (light)

**File:** See `docs/operations/coldcopy-week2-adaptive-strategy.md` — **SCENARIO C: PIVOT APPROACH** (page 3)

---

## QUICK START

1. **On Day 7 (2026-02-29):** Check your metrics
   - Customers acquired this week: ___
   - Revenue total: $___
   - Free signups: ___

2. **Find your scenario** above (A, B, or C)

3. **Open the full strategy document:** `docs/operations/coldcopy-week2-adaptive-strategy.md`

4. **Jump to your scenario** (starts on page 1, 2, or 3)

5. **Follow the Day-by-Day actions** — no thinking required

---

## WHAT'S ALREADY READY

Each scenario includes:

✅ **Day-by-day tactical plans** (Days 8-14)
✅ **Email templates** (ready to send, personalized per scenario)
✅ **Warm outreach scripts** (for Scenario C)
✅ **Reddit backup posts** (if first posts didn't work)
✅ **Metrics dashboard** (what to track daily)
✅ **Decision trees** (when to double down vs. pivot)

Everything is copy-paste ready. No strategy meetings. No additional planning.

---

## KEY PRINCIPLE: FEEDBACK VELOCITY

Paul Graham says: "Do things that don't scale."

Week 2 isn't about automating. It's about **learning what works and doing more of it immediately.**

- If Reddit worked → flood Reddit with posts
- If conversion is leaking → fix the leak fast
- If it's all wrong → pivot to new channel immediately

**The fastest growing companies optimize their *feedback loop*, not their traffic.**

Week 2 is about seeing data (Day 7) and acting on it by Day 8.

---

## THE ONLY METRIC THAT MATTERS

By Day 14: **How many paying customers do you have?**

- 10+: You're winning. Scale aggressively.
- 5-10: You're on track. Double down.
- 1-4: You have something, but conversion is weak. Fix the funnel.
- 0: Wrong channel or wrong positioning. Pivot immediately.

Revenue > Traffic > Signups > Vanity metrics.

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

Each scenario includes "Emergency Pivot" options.

If Week 2 also doesn't work:
- **Scenario B has this:** What to do if A/B testing doesn't help
- **Scenario C has this:** What to do if pivoting fails

There's a decision tree for every situation.

---

## TIMELINE

| Week | What Happens | What You Do |
|------|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Launch, gather data | Execute Day 1 playbook |
| **Day 7** | Results come in | Pick scenario (A, B, or C) |
| **Week 2** | Execute adaptive strategy | Follow scenario playbook |
| **Day 14** | New results | Decide: scale, iterate, or pivot |

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**By Day 14:**
- 10+ total customers (Week 1 + Week 2)
- $300+ revenue
- PMF signal in target community (founders doing cold email)
- Clear path for Week 3 (scale the working channel, or pivot if needed)

**That's the win condition.** Not "viral on Reddit." Not "10K signups." Just: Real customers, real revenue, real validation.

## FILES YOU'LL NEED

- `docs/operations/README-COLDCOPY-LAUNCH.md`
- `docs/operations/coldcopy-reddit-posts-FINAL.md`
- `docs/operations/coldcopy-day1-execution.md`

**For Week 2 execution** (NEW):
- **`docs/operations/coldcopy-week2-adaptive-strategy.md`** ← MAIN PLAYBOOK
  - Has all 3 scenarios
  - Pick yours on Day 7, execute Days 8-14

**Supporting materials** (already ready):
- `docs/marketing/coldcopy-launch-strategy.md` (full context if needed)
- `docs/sales/coldcopy-pricing-strategy.md` (if you need pricing context)

---

## FINAL THOUGHT

By Day 14, you'll have 2 weeks of real customer feedback.

That's worth more than 2 months of strategy planning.

The goal of Week 2 isn't perfection. It's **clarity.**

You'll know:
- Does the market want this? (customer count)
- Can they afford it? (revenue per customer)
- What messaging works? (which post, email, or channel performed)
- What's the bottleneck? (traffic? conversion? product UX?)

Week 2 is about turning hunches into data.

**You have everything you need. Execute.**
