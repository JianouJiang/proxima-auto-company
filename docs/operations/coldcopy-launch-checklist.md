## CRITICAL ENGAGEMENT RULES

### DO:
✓ Reply to EVERY comment within 1 hour
✓ Lead with value, mention product second
✓ Be honest about limitations
✓ Share specific numbers (12-15%, not "high")
✓ Acknowledge valid criticism
✓ Ask follow-up questions

### DON'T:
❌ Post all subreddits same day (looks spammy)
❌ Use marketing language ("just launched," "revolutionizing")
❌ Mention product in original post (only in comments)
❌ Ignore negative feedback
❌ Post same copy to all subreddits
❌ Vanish after post (engagement dies)

---

## WHEN SOMEONE ASKS "HOW DO I TRY THIS?"

**Your response:**
```
Free tier: 3 sequences/month, no credit card required.

Or if you want unlimited from day one, we're doing founding member pricing
for the first week: $49 lifetime access (vs. $19/month recurring).

Try free first, then decide.
```

## METRICS TRACKING

### Daily Checklist

Every morning, 5 minutes:

1. Check Google Analytics
   - Visitors from each source (r/startups, r/sales, r/Entrepreneur, HN)
   - Landing page bounce rate
   - Free tier signups

2. Check Stripe Dashboard
   - Any new customers?
   - Which tier? ($19/mo or $49 lifetime?)

3. Check Subreddit Posts
   - Upvote count
   - Comment count
   - New questions to answer

### Spreadsheet to Track

```
| Date | Post | Upvotes | Comments | Clicks | Signups | Conversions |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|---------|-------------|
| 2/22 | r/startups | | | | | |
| 2/22 | r/Entrepreneur | | | | | |
| 2/23 | r/sales | | | | | |
| 2/26 | HN | | | | | |
| 2/27 | r/SideProject | | | | | |
```

## IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

### Post Gets 0 Upvotes

**Likely cause:** Timing was bad, or post felt salesy
**Action:** Don't repost. Learn and move on. Analyze:
- Was title clear?
- Did opening lead with value?
- Did I mention product in first paragraph?

### No Comments After 2 Hours

**Likely cause:** Post isn't resonating with that community
**Action:** Continue engaging on other posts. Not every post wins.

### Reddit Removes Your Post

**Likely cause:** You mentioned product too much, or mods flagged as spam
**Action:** Don't argue with mods. Accept and learn. Move on to next platform.

### Upvotes Come But No Conversions

**Likely cause:** Landing page copy issue, or paywall not firing
**Action:** Check Google Analytics → See where traffic drops off → Fix copy or paywall

## AFTER WEEK 1: Next Steps

**If 5-10 customers acquired:**
- Congratulations, you have PMF signal
- Continue Reddit strategy (post weekly insights)
- Move to Week 2: Email list building + warm outreach
- Review customer feedback for product roadmap

**If <5 customers:**
- Analyze what worked (which post performed best?)
- Double down on that channel
- Check landing page copy (maybe "reply rate" messaging not working?)
- Consider: Lower price to $9/month to test elasticity
- Consider: Add free 7-day trial of Pro tier (remove friction)

**If 10+ customers:**
- You're onto something big
- Scale this immediately (more Reddit communities, twitter, Product Hunt)
- Raise price to $29/month (test elasticity upward)
- Add more product features
