## After Week 1: Decision Tree

### If successful (5-10 customers):
1. Celebrate
2. Repeat weekly: Post new insight to r/startups (consistency)
3. Build email list (lead magnet: "30-Day Cold Email Playbook")
4. Expand to Twitter + Product Hunt (scale winning playbook)
5. Product roadmap: Feature requests from first customers

### If partially successful (2-4 customers):
1. Analyze: Which post performed best? Which community?
2. Double down on winner (more posts to that community)
3. Check landing page copy (maybe "reply rate" messaging not resonating?)
4. Test: Lower price to $9/month (test elasticity)
5. Test: Add free 7-day Pro trial (remove payment friction)

### If unsuccessful (<2 customers):
1. Verify paywall is firing (check database/logs)
2. Check landing page conversion (maybe traffic but no conversions?)
3. Analyze copy feedback (was positioning unclear?)
4. Consider: Reddit/HN might not be your channel. Try Twitter or Product Hunt instead.
5. Pivot: Maybe bundle with "Email Masterclass" PDF and sell on Gumroad as one-time product
