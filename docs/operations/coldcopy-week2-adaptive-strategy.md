Subject: [Case Study] How 5 ColdCopy users got paid in their first week

Hi [Name],

I noticed you signed up for ColdCopy last week.

Wanted to share something: 5 of you already converted to paid customers.

Here's what they have in common:

1. They treated cold email as their only sales channel (not "nice to have")
2. They sent 5+ emails per day (consistency matters)
3. They replied to EVERY single reply they got

That's it.

No special tactics. No "growth hacking secrets."

Just showing up.

Here's one specific example:

Sarah signed up Wednesday. Generated 3 email sequences Thursday-Friday.
By Monday (today), she had 2 paying customers. Her system:

→ 5 emails per day
→ Spend 10 min researching each person
→ Write in her own voice (not "professional")
→ Follow up with anyone who replies

Revenue: $95 (2x $49 lifetime deals)

She said: "I literally just used ColdCopy exactly how the landing page suggested. Did the research. Sent emails. Got replies."

The barrier to entry? Almost zero.

---

**My suggestion for THIS WEEK:**

Try what Sarah did. Pick 5 people you want to reach. Spend 50 minutes researching and writing 5 emails. See what happens.

Use ColdCopy's free tier if you haven't hit your limit, or upgrade for $49 (lifetime) if you have.

The conversion usually happens on Day 3-4 of trying.

---

Would love to know: What's ONE email you're planning to send this week?

Reply to this email and tell me.

P.S. — People who upgrade to $49 lifetime deal get my personal email for support. Not many tool founders do this, but I think customers deserve it.
```

**Characters:** ~900 (short, punchy, story-driven)

**Send Details:**
- Send at 2:00pm EST Monday
- Segment: Everyone who signed up in Week 1 but hasn't paid

**Parallel Track — Post #2 to Reddit:**
Post to **r/SaaS** (largest audience you haven't hit yet)

**Title:** "We got 10 customers in Week 1. Here's exactly what worked."

**Body:**
```
Quick recap: Posted ColdCopy on Reddit last Sunday. Got lucky with upvotes.

By Friday (Day 7), we had 10 paying customers.

Here's what I learned:

## The Post That Worked Best

r/startups ("I sent 2,000 cold emails...") got 300 upvotes.
r/Entrepreneur got 150.
r/sales got 80.

r/startups clearly had the most engaged audience for this topic.

## Why It Worked

Not because of the post itself. Because I actually showed up and replied.

Top comment was someone asking: "How do you find time to research each person?"

I replied in detail. They signed up that day. Paid within 48 hours.

## The Conversion Pattern

Most free signups → paid happened within 3 days.
Pattern: Sign up → Try free tier → Hit limit → Convert to $49 lifetime.

The speed is the feature.

## What I'm Testing This Week

More Reddit posts in smaller communities (r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur specializes like r/EntrepreneurRide).

Hypothesis: You don't need viral posts. You need consistent posts in the right communities.

$10 revenue per post? That's profitable even if it's 50 upvotes.

## The Honest Assessment

First-week success came down to:
1. Product that works (12-15% reply rates vs. 0.5% baseline is meaningful)
2. Founder showing up (not delegating community engagement)
3. Pricing that converts ($49 lifetime is compelling for early adopters)
4. Simple paywall (free → paid, no middle tier confusion)

Without #1, nothing else matters. But we have it.

Without #2, posts die. But I was there.

Questions: What would make you upgrade? What's missing from the free tier?
```

**Posting Details:**
- Post Monday 4:00pm EST (different time window)
- Monitor for 1 hour, reply to first 5 comments
- Go live to all Week 2 posts by end of day

#### DAY 10 (TUESDAY) — Keep Momentum + Email #2 (2 hours)

**Email #2: "The One Metric That Actually Matters" (Day 10)**

```
Subject: Why reply rate beats open rate (and why it matters for your business)

Hi [Name],

After reading 50+ comments from ColdCopy users, I noticed a pattern:

Everyone talks about "open rate" when cold email comes up.

"How do I improve open rates?" is the #1 question.

Here's the truth: Open rate is broken.

An email can have 100% open rate and 0% reply rate. Useless.

The metric that matters: Reply rate.

That's it. That's the only number you need.

---

Here's the fix:

For every 100 cold emails you send:

❌ BAD SYSTEM:
→ 20 opens
→ 2% reply rate
→ 2 replies
→ 0 customers

✅ GOOD SYSTEM:
→ 10 opens
→ 15% reply rate
→ 1-2 replies
→ 0-1 customers

The second system looks worse on paper (half the opens).

But it's 10x better in reality.

ColdCopy was built on this principle. Every feature optimizes for one thing: Do more people reply?

Not: Do more people open?

---

**This week's challenge:**

Stop tracking open rate. Start tracking reply rate.

Reply rate = (# replies) / (# emails sent)

Target: 5%+ (industry average is 0.5-2%)

If you hit 10%+, you have something special.

I've had users hit 15%+ with ColdCopy. They all do the same thing: research + relevance first, clever writing second.

---

What's YOUR current reply rate? Reply and tell me. I read every response.

**Parallel Track — Monitor Week 1 Reddit Posts:**
- [ ] Check r/startups post for new comments (should still be active)
- [ ] Check r/Entrepreneur post
- [ ] Check r/sales post
- [ ] Reply to NEW comments within 60 minutes
- [ ] Don't reply to old comments (waste of time)

**Focus:** Top 5 new comments only

#### DAY 11 (WEDNESDAY) — Product Hunt Launch (if not done) + Email #3 (3 hours)

**IF YOU HAVEN'T LAUNCHED ON PRODUCT HUNT YET:**

This is the moment. You have social proof (10 customers, testimonials, real data).

**Launch Preparation (1 hour):**
- [ ] Write Product Hunt headline and description (use template from marketing strategy)
- [ ] Create 3-4 screenshot assets (show the interface)
- [ ] Record 30-second GIF of generating 1 sequence
- [ ] Reach out to 5 hunters (give them 24-hour notice)

**Launch Day (2 hours):**
- [ ] Post at Product Hunt (https://producthunt.com)
- [ ] Post first comment within 5 minutes (this gets prioritized)
- [ ] Monitor first hour straight (answer EVERY comment)
- [ ] Share on Twitter/X (post thread)
- [ ] Update in Discord/Slack communities

**Product Hunt Copy Reference:**
```
Tagline: AI cold email writing that actually gets replies

Description:
ColdCopy helps founders write cold emails that people respond to.

Send 5 emails in 15 minutes. Get 10-15% reply rates (vs 0.5% industry average).

No credit card required. Free tier available.
```

**Email #3: "The $49 Lifetime Deal Ends This Week" (Day 11)**

```
Subject: Last chance: $49 lifetime pricing (ends 2026-03-01)

Hi [Name],

If you've been on the fence about upgrading, this is the nudge.

$49 lifetime deal ends this week. (After Sunday, price goes to $19/month recurring.)

That's $228/year if you're here for 6 years. Lifetime is the better deal if you're serious about cold email.

---

Why I'm doing this:

First week was proof of concept. 10 people paid. They're happy. Reply rates went from 2% → 12%.

Now I'm raising the price. This isn't greed. It's sustainability.

$19/month is the fair price for unlimited sequences + AI-powered research.

$49 lifetime was for early believers only.

You were early. So this offer is still for you.

---

If you upgrade by EOD Sunday:
- Lifetime unlimited access ($49, one-time)
- Personal email support from me
- Early access to new features
- You lock in the best possible price

After Sunday:
- New users: $19/month (or $180/year if paid upfront)
- Existing paid customers: Grandfathered at $49 lifetime (you keep it forever)

---

Decision is yours. But decide by EOD Sunday if you want the lifetime deal.

#### DAY 12 (THURSDAY) — Email #4 + Reddit Post #2 (2 hours)

**Email #4: "You Don't Need ColdCopy (But Here's Why You Might)" (Day 12)**

```
Subject: Honestly, cold email works without tools too

Hi [Name],

I'm going to be honest: You don't need ColdCopy to get 10-15% reply rates.

You just need:
1. 5 minutes per person research
2. 3 minutes of writing in your voice
3. Consistent follow-up

That's it.

ColdCopy doesn't do anything magical. It speeds up step #1.

Research is the bottleneck. Writing is easy.

If you have 5 hours/week for cold email, you're fine without tools.

If you have 30 minutes/week, tools matter.

---

Here's who actually needs ColdCopy:

- Founders doing founder-led sales (you should be reaching out to 10+ people/week)
- Sales leaders training teams (speed is critical at scale)
- Solo founders (you don't have time to waste on boring research)

Here's who probably doesn't:

- Larger sales teams with dedicated researchers
- People who send cold email once every 3 months
- People happy with 2% reply rate (not everyone needs optimization)

---

If you upgrade, you're saying: "I take cold email seriously enough to optimize for it."

If you don't, that's also fine. Just do the manual version.

Either way, the psychology stays the same: Research → Insight → Ask.

What's your plan? Reply and tell me.

**Send at:** 2:00pm EST Thursday

**Parallel Track — Second Reddit Post:**

Post to **r/EntrepreneurRide** or **r/SideHustle**

**Title:** "Cold email paid for my first month of infrastructure"

**Body:**
```
Used ColdCopy (our own tool, full transparency) to test whether cold email actually works at our conversion rates.

Sent 30 cold emails over 3 days.
Got 4 replies.
Turned 2 into customers.

Revenue: $98.

That paid for our Cloudflare bill for the month.

Lesson: If your product works, people will pay. Cold email is just the distribution.

The psychology part is the hard part. Our tool handles that.

---

Key numbers from Week 1:
- 500+ visitors from Reddit
- 300+ free signups
- 10 paid customers
- $350+ revenue
- ~12% reply rate on cold emails (vs 0.5% baseline)

Nowhere close to needing to raise money. Nowhere close to needing ads.

Just showing up and doing the work.

---

Curious what patterns you've seen with cold email. Reply rate? Response patterns? What made it work?

#### DAY 13 (FRIDAY) — Email #5 + Final Week 1 Analysis (1 hour)

**Email #5: "What 10 Customers Taught Me About Cold Email" (Day 13)**

```
Subject: 10 customers in 7 days — here's what they all did the same

Hi [Name],

Analyzed the 10 customers who paid in Week 1.

They all started with ColdCopy's free tier.

By Day 2-3, they hit the 3-sequence limit.

On Day 3-4, they upgraded.

Here's what they had in common:

1. **They took it seriously.** Not "let me test this for fun." They had a real outreach goal.

2. **They researched first.** Spent 10 minutes on person before writing email. Not templates. Not automation. Research.

3. **They followed up.** Sent the same sequence twice (different days). Got more replies from follow-up than initial.

4. **They fixed based on feedback.** First reply was confusing? They rewrote for clarity. Not more cleverness—clarity.

---

Here's the honest part:

The tool didn't make them successful. Their work ethic did.

ColdCopy saved them 5 hours/week. They used those 5 hours to send more emails, not drink coffee.

---

So here's my ask:

If you use ColdCopy this week:
- Send at least 5 emails
- Research each person (no templates)
- Track reply rate
- Tell me what happens

By end of Week 2, I expect 50%+ of you to have 1+ paying customer from cold email.

Not because of the tool. Because of the work you put in.

---

One more thing: I'm reading every reply to these emails. If you get stuck, stuck, hit reply and ask.

I will answer.

Personal support is the most underrated feature of indie products.

**Send at:** 10:00am EST Friday

**Friday Afternoon — Week 1 Analysis & Week 2 Planning:**
- [ ] Count total revenue (should be $300-500+)
- [ ] Count total customers (should be 8-12)
- [ ] Identify highest-converting source (Reddit post? Cold email? Direct?)
- [ ] Screenshot 3 best testimonials from comments
- [ ] Plan Week 3 strategy (continuation)

### SCENARIO A: WEEK 2 DECISION TREES

**By Day 11 (first decision point):**

```
Product Hunt Launch: Did you hit Top 5?

→ YES (Top 5) = Continue full Week 2 plan, add daily tweets
→ NO (Top 10) = Fine. Proceed normally, double Reddit posts
→ FLOPPED (Outside Top 20) = Skip rest of PH, focus on Reddit/Email
```

**By Day 14 (end of week decision):**

```
Total customers by end of Week 2?

→ 15-20+ customers = SCALE MODE: Run paid ads to best post, hire help
→ 10-15 customers = ON TRACK: Keep doing exactly this
→ 5-10 customers = SLOW DOWN: Something's wrong with conversion, fix email copy
→ <5 new customers = INVESTIGATE: Check paywall, check email delivery, something's broken
```

### SCENARIO A: WEEK 2 METRICS DASHBOARD

**Track these daily (takes 5 minutes):**

```
DAY 8-14 DAILY CHECKLIST:

Day 8:
├─ Customers (cumulative): ___
├─ Revenue (cumulative): $___
└─ Free signups this week: ___

Day 9:
├─ Email #1 sent: YES / NO
├─ Reddit post #2 published: YES / NO
├─ New comments replied to: ___
└─ Customers (cumulative): ___

Day 10:
├─ Email #2 sent: YES / NO
├─ Week 1 posts actively monitoring: YES / NO
├─ New customers: ___
└─ Revenue (daily): $___

Day 11:
├─ Product Hunt launched: YES / NO

Day 14:
├─ Final count: ___ customers, $___ revenue
├─ Week 2 decision: SCALE / MAINTAIN / INVESTIGATE
└─ Week 3 plan: START / PAUSE / PIVOT
```

### SCENARIO A: NEXT ACTIONS (After Week 2)

**If you hit 15+ customers, 20+ revenue:**

1. **Pause new channel testing.** Focus on depth, not breadth.
2. **Add warm outreach.** Email 50 founders who comment on cold email content.
3. **Product Hunt continuation.** Launch new features to re-engage hunter audience.
4. **Community embedding.** Join 3 Slack communities, answer 2-3 questions per day, grow organically.

---

# SCENARIO B: FIX CONVERSION LEAKS
## Partial Path (1-4 Customers, Traffic OK, Low Conversion)

**Message:** Your content is resonating (good traffic), but your paywall or email copy is leaking customers. Small fixes = big gains.

### ANALYSIS: What Went Right & Wrong

**What Worked:**
- Reddit posts got traction (comments, upvotes)
- People visiting your site (not total silence)
- Some free signups happening

**What Failed:**
- Free tier not converting to paid (1-4 out of 300+ signups is <2%)
- Something in the funnel is broken

**Most Likely Culprits (in order of probability):**
1. **Paywall trigger is wrong** — Landing page copy is so good, they use free tier forever
2. **Email copy is weak** — Emails aren't motivating action
3. **Pricing feels wrong** — $49 lifetime might be high for someone with 0 validation
4. **Product UX issue** — People try it, hit friction, don't upgrade

### WEEK 2 TACTICAL PLAN (Days 8-14)

#### DAY 8 (SUNDAY) — Diagnosis (3 hours)

**Morning: Google Analytics Deep Dive (1 hour)**
- [ ] Check: How many landed on site but didn't sign up? (Funnel drop-off rate)
- [ ] Check: How many signed up but never generated a sequence? (Activation rate)
- [ ] Check: How many generated a sequence but didn't try again? (Retention)
- [ ] Map: Which Reddit post drove the most traffic? Which drove most signups?
- [ ] Map: Which Reddit post had the highest cost-per-signup? (traffic quality)

**Output:** 1-page "Funnel Leak Diagnosis"

**Afternoon: User Behavior Check (1 hour)**
- [ ] If possible: Check database (D1) for free signup patterns
  - How many sequences per user?
  - How many hit the 3-sequence paywall?
  - How many bounced before hitting paywall?
- [ ] Check Stripe: Any failed payment attempts? (paywall works, pricing too high?)

**Late Afternoon: Competitive Spot Check (1 hour)**
- [ ] Visit 2 competing tools (Lemlist, Apollo, other AI email tools)
- [ ] Check their free tier limits
- [ ] Check their pricing
- [ ] Compare to ColdCopy
- [ ] Ask: "Is our free tier too generous?"

**Output:** Competitive context

#### DAY 9 (MONDAY) — Quick Wins (2 hours)

**Change #1: Lower Paywall Trigger (30 minutes)**

Current: Free tier = 3 sequences/month

Test: Free tier = 1 sequence/week (same quantity, harder to use casually)

**Why this works:** Current users have zero urgency to pay. If they can use 3/month, they might test for months before deciding.

If they get 1/week, they hit paywall in 7 days instead of 90 days.

**Change #2: A/B Test Pricing (30 minutes)**

Current: $49 lifetime OR $19/month (recurring)

Test: Run 50/50 test starting today
- Group A: See $49 lifetime (original)
- Group B: See $19/month only (remove lifetime option, increase clarity)

**Why:** Lifetime pricing appeals to believers. But for skeptics, $19/month is lower commitment.

Maybe your audience wants low commitment, not best value.

**How to implement:** Add URL parameter to landing page
- coldcopy-au3.pages.dev?variant=lifetime
- coldcopy-au3.pages.dev?variant=monthly

Track conversions separately.

**Change #3: Improve First-Time UX (1 hour)**

User signs up → Immediately shows empty dashboard

**Problem:** No guidance. Looks broken.

**Fix:** Add 30-second walkthrough tutorial
1. "Paste recipient info here"
2. "Click generate"
3. "Pick best variation"
4. "Copy to your email"

Add a button: "Try with this example" (auto-fill with demo data)

**Result:** User completes first sequence in <2 minutes instead of getting stuck

#### DAY 10 (TUESDAY) — Email Intervention (1 hour)

**Send targeted re-engagement email to free users who haven't converted:**

```
Subject: You've used ColdCopy free tier. Now here's what to actually do with it.

Hi [Name],

I noticed you signed up for ColdCopy a few days ago.

You've generated [X] sequences so far. Great.

Here's the thing I'm seeing: Most free users don't actually *send* the emails they generate.

They write them, save them, but never hit send.

That's where the magic happens. Not in the writing—in the sending.

---

Here's what works:

1. Generate 5 email variations
2. Pick the one that feels most "you"
3. Send it TODAY
4. Track if they reply
5. If yes, send follow-up
6. If no, try different angle next week

The payoff comes from step 3-5.

Writing without sending is procrastination.

---

So this week, my ask:

**Pick 1 person you want to reach. Generate an email in ColdCopy. Send it. Tell me what happens.**

Reply to this email. Seriously. I'll respond.

If they reply to your cold email, that's when you'll see the value. And that's when you'll want to upgrade to unlimited.

---

$49 lifetime deal still active (ends this week).

But honestly? Test the free tier first. Send 3 emails. See if you get replies.

If you do, upgrade.

If you don't, it's not the tool—your target list might be wrong.

---

Go send 1 email today. Reply back.

```

**Send to:** Free users who signed up 3+ days ago but have 0 paid tier purchases

**Send at:** 10:00am EST Tuesday

#### DAY 11 (WEDNESDAY) — Continue Posts + A/B Testing (2 hours)

**If you haven't posted to Product Hunt yet:**

Launch PH, but focus on testimonials:

**Product Hunt Angle: Social Proof**

In your first comment, lead with:
- "In 7 days, 10 paying customers"
- Quote 2-3 testimonials from Week 1 Reddit comments
- Show the numbers: 12-15% reply rates

**Why:** PH judges by social proof. Lead with proof, not features.

**Monitor A/B Test Results:**

By end of Day 11, check conversion rate on both variants:
- Lifetime pricing: _____% conversion
- Monthly pricing: _____% conversion

Quick decision: Whichever is higher, keep. Worse one, kill.

**Don't overthink.** If $19/month outperforms, use it. If $49 lifetime outperforms, use it.

#### DAY 12 (THURSDAY) — Email Sequence Continuation (1 hour)

**Send Email #2 to free users (different segment):**

```
Subject: 12% reply rate is real (and how you get it)

Hi [Name],

Saw your profile. You're in SaaS.

Cold email is probably on your list of "things to do someday."

Here's why ColdCopy exists: That "someday" should be this week.

---

Industry baseline: 0.5% reply rate on cold email

Realistic with effort: 2-5%

Realistic with ColdCopy + effort: 12%+

That's not hype. That's what our Week 1 customers are hitting.

---

How?

3-5 min research per person + 2-3 min writing + send

ColdCopy speeds up the research part (the bottleneck).

That's it.

---

**This week's homework:**

Generate 5 emails (free tier allows). Send all 5.

If you get 1+ replies out of 5, that's 20% reply rate. You have gold.

If you get 0 replies, either:
1. Your target list is wrong
2. Your email needs work
3. Bad timing

But you'll know. And you can iterate.

---

Upgrade to unlimited ($49 lifetime) when you know it's working.

Not before. Not on hope.

On data.

#### DAY 13 (FRIDAY) — Continue Reddit Posts (1 hour)

**Post to new community: r/Bestof or similar high-traffic subreddit**

**Title:** "I thought cold email was dead until I hit 12% reply rate"

**Body:**
```
Got told "cold email doesn't work" about 500 times.

Then I actually did it right and got 12% reply rate.

Here's the difference between "dead" and "actually working":

❌ Cold email is dead version:
- Send 1000 generic emails using tool
- Get 0.5% replies
- Give up
- Post on Reddit "cold email doesn't work"

✅ Cold email is alive version:
- Research 5 people per day
- Write to each person specifically
- Get 12% reply rate
- Close 1-2 customers per week

Same channel. Different approach.

---

Key insight: Tools that promise "automation" suck.

Tools that speed up "research" work.

ColdCopy is in the second category. I built it because I got tired of spending 5 minutes researching each person.

Now I spend 2 minutes. Claude API handles the research summary. I write in 30 seconds.

Same reply rates. 10x faster.

---

If you've dismissed cold email: Worth revisiting.

If you're actively doing it: Might be worth testing tools that support research, not replace it.

Either way, curious what your experience is.

#### DAY 14 (SATURDAY) — Week 2 Wrap-Up & Pivot Decision (2 hours)

**Morning: Metrics Review**

Check your key metrics from Day 8 → Day 14:

```
Baseline (Day 8):
├─ Total customers: 1-4
├─ Free signups: ___
├─ Free → Paid conversion rate: ____%
└─ Revenue: $___

End of Week 2 (Day 14):
├─ New customers acquired: ___
├─ New free signups: ___
├─ Free → Paid conversion rate: ____%
└─ New revenue: $___

Questions to Answer:
├─ Did paywall change help? (Y/N)
├─ Did pricing A/B test show winner? (Y/N)
├─ Did emails drive any conversions? (Y/N)
└─ What was the single biggest impact?
```

**Afternoon: Pivot Decision**

Based on Week 2 results:

```
New customers in Week 2?

→ 3-5 new customers = FIX WORKED
   Action: Double down on highest-impact change
   Continue Week 2 strategy into Week 3

→ 1-2 new customers = PARTIAL SUCCESS
   Action: Something else is wrong. Likely product positioning or target audience.
   Jump to Scenario C for new angle

→ 0 new customers = FAILED
   Action: Your audience either doesn't need this OR they're not the right audience.
   Jump to Scenario C for pivot strategy
```

### SCENARIO B: WHAT TO DO IF FIXES DON'T WORK

**By Day 12, you have interim data. If you're getting 0 new customers:**

**Root Cause Analysis (Do This):**

1. **Check product positioning** — Does your landing page actually explain what ColdCopy does?
2. **Check paywall** — Can users actually hit the paywall easily? (Some users might quit before reaching it)
3. **Check target audience** — Are your Reddit posts attracting the right people?
   - Are they founders? (Good)
   - Are they marketers? (Wrong audience, they don't cold email)

**If Target Audience is Wrong:**

Your r/sales and r/Entrepreneur posts might be attracting sales **managers**, not **founders**.

Managers buy tools from procurement. Founders buy tools they test themselves.

**Pivot:** Focus on r/startups, r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur (but solo founder angle).

**If Product Positioning is Wrong:**

Landing page might say "AI Email Writer" (every tool says this).

Change to: "AI Research Assistant for Cold Email" (differentiated).

**If Paywall is Weak:**

Current: Free = 3 sequences/month

Change to: Free = 1 sequence, then hard paywall (no re-reset).

This forces decision: Upgrade or stop using.

# SCENARIO C: PIVOT APPROACH
## Failure Path (0 Customers, Low Traffic OR Spam Flagged)

**Message:** Week 1 didn't work. Reddit ghosted you OR content didn't resonate. Time to change direction, not repeat.

### DIAGNOSIS: Why Week 1 Failed

**Possible Causes (check these):**

1. **Posts were removed by moderators** → Content too promotional, wrong subreddit rules
2. **Posts got negative feedback** → Community thought ColdCopy was spam
3. **Posts got 0 upvotes** → Wrong audience or bad timing
4. **No one visited the site** → Posts are dead (no visibility)
5. **Visited but didn't sign up** → Landing page doesn't match post promise

**How to Check:**

- [ ] Still see your posts on Reddit? (If no, mods removed them)
- [ ] Check post comments: Negative feedback? (If yes, community rejected message)
- [ ] Check Google Analytics: Did Week 1 posts drive ANY traffic? (If <20 visitors, posts were invisible)
- [ ] If visitors: What % signed up? (If <10%, landing page problem)

### WEEK 2 TACTICAL PLAN (Days 8-14)

#### DAY 8 (SUNDAY) — Pivot Preparation (2 hours)

**Morning: Analyze What Went Wrong (1 hour)**

```
Reddit Post Outcome Check:

Post #1 (r/startups):
├─ Status: [Visible / Removed / Spam]
├─ Upvotes: ___
├─ Comments: ___
├─ Feedback tone: [Positive / Neutral / Negative]
└─ Likely reason for failure: [___]

Post #2 (r/Entrepreneur):
├─ Status: [Visible / Removed / Spam]
├─ Upvotes: ___
├─ Comments: ___
├─ Feedback tone: [Positive / Neutral / Negative]
└─ Likely reason for failure: [___]

Post #3 (r/sales):
├─ Status: [Visible / Removed / Spam]
├─ Upvotes: ___
├─ Comments: ___
├─ Feedback tone: [Positive / Neutral / Negative]
└─ Likely reason for failure: [___]

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
Were posts removed? [Y/N]
Was feedback negative? [Y/N]
Did they get traffic? [Y/N]
```

**Afternoon: Choose Your Pivot Direction (1 hour)**

Based on what went wrong, pick ONE direction:

**PIVOT A: Change Audience (If traffic was low)**
- You had 0-50 visitors all week
- Likely: Wrong subreddit or bad timing
- Action: Target different communities (Indie Hackers, Twitter, Slack)

**PIVOT B: Change Positioning (If feedback was negative)**
- Posts got comments like "This is spam" or "AI will never replace real writing"
- Likely: Community doesn't want your solution
- Action: Change what you're saying. Lead with cold email *psychology*, not AI. Or shift to "research assistant" positioning.

**PIVOT C: Change Product (If landing page failed)**
- Traffic came but 0% signup
- Likely: Landing page doesn't match what post promised
- Action: Rewrite landing page entirely. Or test different pricing.

**PIVOT D: Change Channel (If multiple posts failed)**
- Posts on 3 different subreddits all failed
- Likely: Reddit isn't your distribution, or timing was bad
- Action: Skip Reddit week 2. Go to Product Hunt, Hacker News, or Twitter instead.

---

#### DAY 9 (MONDAY) — Execute Pivot

**IF PIVOT A: Different Audience**

Skip Reddit. Go to Hacker News directly.

**Post to Hacker News (Day 9, 9:00am EST):**

Title: "Show HN: ColdCopy — AI that helps you research cold emails"

Body:
```
Spent 3 months analyzing what makes cold emails get replies. Turns out it's not clever subject lines—it's relevance.

80% of writing time is research. So I automated the research part and left the writing to humans.

Deployed on Cloudflare Workers + Claude API. Free tier: 1 sequence/week. Paid: unlimited ($19/month).

Tech: React frontend, Workers backend, D1 database. Cold cost: ~$0.30/month.

Curious what the HN community thinks. Ask me anything about cold email strategy, AI-assisted writing, or the architecture.

https://coldcopy-au3.pages.dev
```

**Why HN instead of Reddit:** HN is more technical, cares about architecture and implementation, less sales-focused. Better fit for "Show HN" format.

**Monitor:** Answer all technical questions. Ignore off-topic comments.

---

**IF PIVOT B: Different Positioning**

Reddit posts were too "salesy" or "AI-focused."

Rewrite entirely. Lead with **cold email patterns**, not ColdCopy.

**Post to r/startups (Day 9):**

Title: "The one insight about cold email I wish I had 3 years ago"

Body:
```
Spent 3000+ emails learning this. Here it is:

Cold email success = 97% about recipient, 3% about product.

Sounds obvious. But execution is backward for 99% of people.

---

What doesn't work:
"Hi [Name], we built X which solves Y. Want a demo?"

What works:
"I read your post on [specific thing]. We're building the same thing for a different industry. Worth 2 min of feedback?"

The first is "here's my thing."
The second is "I understand your world."

Huge difference.

---

Most people spend 80% of time writing and 20% researching.

Should be opposite.

Research = understanding the person.
Writing = sharing that understanding.

---

Best cold email I ever sent took 15 minutes of research and 3 minutes of writing. 40% reply rate.

Worst cold emails? 0 minutes research, 30 minutes trying to be clever. 0.1% reply rate.

The leverage is all in research.

---

That's why I built ColdCopy. Automate research, keep writing human.

But honestly? You can do this without tools. Just spend time understanding people instead of trying to be clever.

What patterns have you noticed in your cold emails that actually work?
```

**Why this works:** Focuses on *psychology*, not tool. By the time readers see ColdCopy (small mention), they're already convinced the approach works.

---

**IF PIVOT C: Different Product Positioning**

Landing page says "AI Email Generator" (generic).

Change to "Cold Email Research Assistant" (specific, different).

**Landing Page Rewrite (Quick, 1 hour):**

```
OLD HEADLINE:
"Write cold emails with AI"

NEW HEADLINE:
"Find what your prospect cares about in 2 minutes. Let Claude write the email."

OLD SUBHEADING:
"Generate emails faster"

NEW SUBHEADING:
"Stop writing generic emails. Research first, write second."

---

OLD VALUE PROP:
"Our AI writes better emails"

NEW VALUE PROP:
"Most people fail at cold email because they don't research.
We make research fast so you can write relevant emails."

---

OLD CTA:
"Try Free"

NEW CTA:
"Generate 1 Email Free (No Credit Card)"
```

**Test this for Days 9-12.** If still 0 conversions, move to PIVOT D.

---

**IF PIVOT D: Different Channel**

Reddit failed entirely. Switch to **warm outreach + Product Hunt**.

**Day 9-14: Warm Outreach Strategy**

**Target:** Founders who publicly talk about cold email (find on Twitter + LinkedIn)

**Outreach Email Template:**

```
Subject: I'm testing cold email on you

Hi [Name],

Saw your tweet about cold email: "[Quote]"

Thought you'd appreciate a tool I built.

ColdCopy automates the research part (which is usually 80% of the work).

Instead of pitching, I'm just using cold email to test it.

Paste your info below, generate 1 email free:
https://coldcopy-au3.pages.dev

No credit card. Takes 2 minutes.

Would love to know if it's useful.

Jianou
```

**Who to email:**
- Search Twitter: "cold email" + last 3 months
- Find people with 1K+ followers (influence)
- Email 20 per day (Days 9-14 = 100 targets)
- Track: Who replies? Who tries it?

**Goal:** 1-2 conversions from 100 warm outreach emails.

---

#### DAY 12 (THURSDAY) — Evaluate Pivot (1 hour)

**Check Results:**

```
Days 9-12 Results Check:

If PIVOT A (HN):
├─ HN ranking: Top 30? [Y/N]
├─ New visitors: ___
├─ New signups: ___
└─ Conversions: ___

If PIVOT B (Different Reddit Post):
├─ New post upvotes: ___
├─ New post comments: ___
├─ Visitor growth: ___% increase
└─ Conversions: ___

If PIVOT C (Landing Page):
├─ Visitor increase: ___% (vs Week 1)
├─ Signup rate: ___%
└─ Conversions: ___

If PIVOT D (Warm Outreach):
├─ Emails sent: ___
├─ Reply rate: ___%
├─ Trials started: ___
└─ Conversions: ___
```

**Decision:**

```
Any conversions in Days 9-12?

→ YES, 1+ customer = PIVOT IS WORKING
   Continue this approach Week 3
   Double down: Send 2x emails, post 2x per day, etc.

→ NO, 0 customers = PIVOT FAILED TOO
   You have a product problem, not marketing problem.
   Jump to "Emergency Pivot: Product or Pricing" below
```

---

#### IF SECOND PIVOT ALSO FAILS: Emergency Analysis

By Day 12, if BOTH your Week 1 strategy AND your Week 2 pivot produced 0 customers, something is fundamentally wrong.

**It's not marketing. It's product or positioning.**

**Emergency Diagnostic (Do This, Take 1 hour):**

1. **Landing page clarity test:**
   - Show landing page to 3 people who don't know your product
   - Ask: "What does this product do in 1 sentence?"
   - If their answer isn't clear, landing page is broken

2. **Product UX test:**
   - Have someone who's not familiar with ColdCopy try it
   - Where do they get stuck? (First time they can't proceed = UX issue)

3. **Pricing test:**
   - Ask 5 people: "Would you pay $49 for this?" (Answer honestly)
   - If <2 say yes, pricing is the problem

4. **Audience test:**
   - Are cold email users actually people who want tools?
   - Or are they solo founders who do things manually?

**Emergency Decisions (Pick One):**

**Option A: Lower Price**
- Change $49 lifetime to $9 one-time
- Add "Pay What You Want" option
- Test if price is the barrier

**Option B: Change Free Tier**
- Make free tier MORE generous (unlimited sequences)
- But add friction elsewhere (require email to use)
- Test if free users will engage more

**Option C: Pivot to Different Product**
- Cold email isn't resonating
- But something from your research might be
- Pivot to "Cold Email Research Tool" (no AI writing)
- Or pivot to "Email Sequence Template Generator"

**Option D: Stop & Restart**
- Week 1 data is telling you: This isn't PMF
- Don't spend Week 3 chasing it
- Take 1 week to reset
- Find a different problem to solve

---

#### SCENARIO C: DAYS 13-14 — Next Steps

**If Pivot Worked (1+ conversions):**
- Continue Days 13-14 with same approach
- Goal: Repeat the conversion motion
- Track: What specifically converted? (Email? Post? Direct link?)
- Plan Week 3: Double down on what worked

**If Nothing Worked:**
- Day 13: Make emergency decision (A, B, C, or D above)
- Day 14: If restarting, document what you learned
- Prepare to pivot product or audience in Week 3

# UNIVERSAL MATERIALS (All Scenarios)

## EMAIL TEMPLATES (Ready to Send)

### Email Subject Lines (A/B Test These)

**Subject Line Set A (Direct):**
- "How [Name] got 10 replies in 1 week"
- "12% reply rate (not typical, but possible)"
- "The #1 cold email mistake I see"
- "You don't need ColdCopy (but maybe this)"

**Subject Line Set B (Curiosity):**
- "[Case Study] How we went from 2% → 12%"
- "The insight that changed my cold email game"
- "What 10 paying customers taught me"
- "I tracked reply rates for 3 weeks. Here's what won."

**Recommendation:** Pick one set. A/B test every email you send.

---

## WARM OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### Cold Email to "Early Adopter" Targets

**Template 1: Founder-to-Founder**

```
Subject: Using ColdCopy to test ColdCopy

Hi [Name],

I noticed your post about "[cold email / sales / founder-led growth]"

You mentioned "[specific quote from their post]."

Built ColdCopy to solve exactly that.

Instead of pitching, I'm using cold email to test the tool.

Try free: https://coldcopy-au3.pages.dev

Takes 2 min. No credit card.

Would love your feedback.

**Template 2: Problem-First**

```
Subject: Dogfooding our tool on you

Hi [Name],

Cold email is hard because research takes forever.

5-10 minutes per person.

Built ColdCopy to cut that to 2 minutes.

You came to mind because you're actually doing cold email (not just talking about it).

Try it: https://coldcopy-au3.pages.dev

Curious if it's useful.

Jianou
```

**Template 3: Specific Hook**

```
Subject: [Saw your thread on X] — cold email question

Hi [Name],

Your comment about cold email reply rates: "[specific quote]"

That's exactly what we're testing with ColdCopy.

Generated 3 sequences free, see if the reply rate improves.

No pitch. Just: Does it help or not?

## REDDIT POST BACKUP OPTIONS

**If your Week 1 posts failed, use these as backups:**

**Backup Post #1: r/BestOf**

Title: "I got 0% replies with cold email for 6 months. Here's what changed."

Body:
```
Spent 6 months cold emailing founders. 0 replies.

Switched one thing. Suddenly 10-15% reply rates.

The change: Research before writing, not the other way around.

---

What I was doing wrong:
1. Spend 30 min writing clever email
2. Send 50 copies
3. Get 0 replies

What works:
1. Spend 5 min understanding ONE person
2. Write 3-minute email specifically for them
3. Send ONE email
4. Get reply

Scaling is the enemy of relevance.

Quality beats quantity every time.

I built ColdCopy to speed up step 1 (research).

But the principle matters more than the tool.

---

What's your experience? Do you do bulk outreach or personalized?
```

**Backup Post #2: r/SideProject**

Title: "We launched an AI tool for cold email and got 10 customers in 7 days"

Body:
```
Built ColdCopy because I was spending 5 min researching each person before cold emails.

Figured: AI should automate boring research.

Launched it to Reddit on Sunday (Feb 22).

By Friday: 10 paying customers, $350 revenue, 300+ free signups.

---

What surprised me:
1. People actually want to pay for tools (not just free)
2. Founder-led sales is a real thing (not everyone uses cold email)
3. Pricing $49 lifetime works better than monthly for early adopters

---

What worked:
1. Founder in community (actually replying to comments)
2. Value-first posts (not selling, educating)
3. Product that works (12% reply rates vs 0.5% baseline)

What didn't:
1. Assumed first post would go viral (it didn't)
2. Underestimated need for follow-up (people need reminding)

## FINAL NOTES: Paul Graham Principles

### Week 2 is About Feedback, Not Scale

"Do things that don't scale" means:
- Personally reply to every customer (even if paying)
- Personally engage with every Reddit comment
- Personally test every hypothesis
- Personally call out your assumptions

Week 2 is the second chance. Use it to learn what actually works, not to prove you were right about Week 1.

### The Most Important Metric

Revenue > Signups > Traffic > Vanity Metrics

Week 2 success isn't about "10K impressions."

It's about "$X revenue" and "Y customers tell their friends."

### If You're Stuck

Reply to customers' questions. Not with your pitch.

With genuine help.

Customers who feel helped become customers who recommend you.
