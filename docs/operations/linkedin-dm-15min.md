## ONE Template (Copy-Paste Only)

```
Hey [Name] — Saw you liked/commented on my ColdCopy post.

Built a tool that saves 30 min/week on cold outreach. Paste a LinkedIn profile, get a personalized message in seconds.

Live demo (free tier): https://5c623820.coldcopy-au3.pages.dev

Early access is $19. If it saves you time, try it. If it doesn't, tell me why so I can fix it.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

**Word count:** 54 words. Under 100. Direct ask. No fluff.

## People to DM

[FOUNDER: Check LinkedIn post 7430604875568246784 for names of people who liked/commented]

**Action:**
1. Open post link above
2. Scroll to "Likes" section
3. List the first 10-15 names
4. Send them the template message above
5. Update this file with names and send status

**Why:** You can see engagement in real-time. I don't have API access to pull that list, so you pull it.

## Expected Outcome

- **Response rate:** 5-20% (1-3 people)
- **Conversion rate:** 10-30% of respondents (1 paying customer)
- **Timeline:** First response within 2-4 hours
- **Time commitment:** 15 min now + 5 min replies later

---

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT customize beyond [Name] and [Your Name]
- Do NOT ask permission or overthink
- Do NOT research their company first
- Do NOT write your own version
- Do NOT send multiple messages to same person

**Just copy. Paste. Send. 15 minutes.**

---

## Tracking

After sending all messages, fill this table:

| Name | Sent? | Responded? | Interested? | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| [Name 1] | ✓ | - | - | - |
| [Name 2] | ✓ | ✓ | Yes | Asked about pricing |
| [Name 3] | ✓ | - | - | - |

Update `docs/operations/user-acquisition-log.md` after each response.

## Why This Works

- **Saw your engagement:** They already know who you are (warm network)
- **One specific ask:** $19, try it, that's it
- **No sales pressure:** "Tell me why it sucks" disarms resistance
- **Direct link:** No friction between message and product
- **2% x 100% activation > 30% x 0% activation:** This removes the decision paralysis

## Founder Reality Check

- This takes 15 minutes
- Automated funnel (DevOps) is primary strategy anyway
- These DMs are bonus
- If you don't want to do this, skip it — the funnel is enough
- If you do this, expect 1 customer within 24 hours (not guaranteed, but likely)

**Your choice. 15 minutes. Up to you.**
