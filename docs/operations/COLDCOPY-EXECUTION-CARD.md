## ENGAGEMENT TEMPLATE RESPONSES

### "How do you research?"

```
5-minute process:
1. LinkedIn profile (recent activity, posts)
2. Company website (what they're building)
3. Recent tweets (what's on their mind)
4. Industry news (what's happening in their space)

Look for ONE specific thing they said/did, reference it.

This manual research is the bottleneck—5 min per email.
That's why I built ColdCopy to automate it.

Free: 3 sequences/month, no credit card
https://coldcopy-au3.pages.dev

But honestly, learn the psychology first, then use tools to scale.
```

### "Isn't cold email spam?"

```
Great question.

Spam = unsolicited + irrelevant
Cold email = unsolicited + relevant

If your first line references something specific they said/did,
it's not spam—it's actually helpful.

The moment your email becomes about YOUR product instead of
THEIR world, it fails.

That's the psychology: Make it about them, not you.
```

### "How do I automate this?"

```
You can't automate research. It requires thinking about the person.

What you CAN automate is the writing part—once you've done research.

That's what ColdCopy does: You research, you paste the insight,
it generates 3-5 email variations, you pick the best one, send it.

Turns 15 minutes → 5 minutes.

Try the free tier. 3 sequences/month.

## CRITICAL DON'Ts

❌ Don't mention product in original post (only in comments)
❌ Don't get defensive about criticism
❌ Don't disappear after posting (engagement dies)
❌ Don't copy-paste same post to all communities

## The Core Principle

**Value first. Product second.**

Don't pitch. Teach.

Communities don't want to be sold to. They want to feel helped.

Show up as a real founder who solved a real problem, learned real lessons,
and built a tool to share what you learned.

People naturally ask "how do you do this?" and you say "I built a tool."

They try it free. Some convert to paid.

That's it. That's the whole strategy.
