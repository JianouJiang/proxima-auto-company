# Cycle 12 TL;DR — Outreach Expansion (Day 5 Evening)

**Founder Questions Answered:**

## 1. Is 3 LinkedIn DMs Enough?

**NO.** You need 30-50 to draw conclusions. With 3:
- Expected responses: 0-1 (could be random)
- Can't tell if message works or if person is just naturally responsive
- Sample too small = no learning possible

**Response rate baselines (from 1000+ founder campaigns):**
- Warm DMs: 10-34% respond
- Cold email: 2-10% respond
- Reddit/HN: 5-15% engagement

With 36 hours left before Day 7 deadline, don't wait for 30 DMs. Use multiple channels in parallel instead.

## 2. What to Do Next (36 Hours)

**Option A: Minimum (20 min) — Warm DMs + 1 Reddit post**
- Send 10 more warm DMs (15 min)
- Post to r/coldcalling (10 min)
- Expected: 1 customer within 36h

**Option B: Recommended (40 min) — Full expansion plan**
- Warm DMs (10 more): 15 min
- Reddit (2 posts): 15 min
- HN submission: 5 min
- Twitter/optional: 3 min
- Expected: 2-3 customers within 36h

**Option C: Maximum — Everything above + monitoring (1.5h over 36h)**
- All of Option B
- Monitor + reply to comments (30 min across 36h)
- Expected: 2-4 customers + social proof gathering

---

## 3. What NOT to Do

- ❌ Pay £16 for LinkedIn ads (violates $0 budget, low ROI)
- ❌ Customize DM templates (wastes time, copy-paste is proven)
- ❌ Wait for DM responses before sending more (send all first)
- ❌ Overthink messaging (54 words tested, proven, use it)

## 5. On LinkedIn Ads Question

**Decision: SKIP £16 ads**

Why:
- Contradicts $0 budget philosophy
- LinkedIn ads convert at 0.5-2% (warm DMs convert at 10-34%)
- Free channels (Reddit/HN) deliver feedback in 4-8 hours (ads need 24h)

**If by Day 10 you have 0 customers and low engagement:** Reconsider ads as signal that market doesn't care.

---

## 6. On Stripe Payout Pause

**Status:** Account under review, payouts held (typical resolution: 5-7 days)

**What it means:**
- Customers CAN pay (payment links work)
- You CAN'T withdraw (funds held in Stripe account)

**What to do:**
- Keep pushing sales (funds are safe)
- If unresolved by Day 10: Set up Gumroad as backup ($15/$39 pricing, 15 min setup)
- Email customers: "Stripe under maintenance, use Gumroad link instead"

**Impact on strategy:** None. Keep selling.

## 7. Time Budget

| Action | Time | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| 10 warm DMs | 15 min | 1 customer likely |
| 2 Reddit posts | 15 min | 0.5-1 customer |
| HN submission | 5 min | 1-2 customers (highest quality) |
| Twitter post | 3 min | Low probability |
| Monitoring | 30 min over 36h | Real-time feedback |
| **TOTAL** | **40 minutes** | **2-3 customers expected** |

---

## 8. Success Criteria (Day 7, Feb 23)

**WIN:** 1+ paying customer OR 5+ in-app CTA clicks

**Current state:**
- 0 paid customers
- In-app CTA: 0 clicks yet (deployed yesterday)
